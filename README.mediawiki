== April Project ==

=== What is April ===

April is the 4th month of the year, of course.

It is also the name of my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry CSG] project for Computer Grapics course.

=== Why April ===

I intended to name this project with a female's name starting with 'A'.

'A' is the first letter in alphabet, suggesting a new start (although I won't tell what start it is).

Later projects might start with 'B' and 'C'...
